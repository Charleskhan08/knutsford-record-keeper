    return newStudent;
  }
}
```

Student Table Component (src/components/students/StudentTable.tsx)

  searchTerm = "", 
  filterProgram = "", 
  filterYear = "" 
}: StudentTableProps) {
  const [allStudents, setAllStudents] = useState<Student[]>(() => 
    studentService.getStudents()
  );

  const filteredStudents = useMemo(() => {
    return allStudents.filter((student) => {
      const matchesSearch = searchTerm === "" || 
        student.firstName.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
        student.lastName.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
        student.email.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
